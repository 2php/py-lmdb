### CI State

Release: [![release](https://travis-ci.org/dw/py-lmdb.png?branch=release)](https://travis-ci.org/dw/py-lmdb/branches)

Master: [![master](https://travis-ci.org/dw/py-lmdb.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dw/py-lmdb/branches)

If you care whether the tests are passing, check out the repository and execute
the tests under your desired target Python release, as the Travis CI build has
a bad habit of breaking due to external factors approximately every 3 months.
