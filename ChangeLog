* When multiple cursors exist, and one cursor performs a mutation,
  remaining cursors may have returned corrupt results via key(), value(),
  or item(). Mutations are now explicitly tracked and cause the cursor's
  data to be refreshed in this case.

* setup.py was adjusted to ensure the distutils default of '-DNDEBUG' is never
  defined while building LMDB. This caused many important checks in the engine
  to be disabled.

* The old 'transactionless' API was removed. A future version may support the
  same API, but the implementation will be different.

* Transaction.pop() and Cursor.pop() helpers added, to complement
  Transaction.replace() and Cursor.replace().
