2014-04-30 v0.80

* Both variants now build successfully as 32 bit / 64bit binaries on on
  Windows under Visual Studio 9.0, the compiler for Python 2.7. This enables
  py-lmdb to be installed via pip on Windows without requiring a compiler to
  be available. In future, .egg/.whl releases releases will be pre-built for
  all recent Python versions on Windows.

  Known bugs: Environment.copy() and Environment.copyfd() currently produce a
  database that cannot be reopened.

* The lmdb.enable_drop_gil() function was removed. Its purpose was
  experimental at best, confusing at worst.


2014-03-17 v0.79

* CPython Cursor.delete() lacked dupdata argument, fixed.

* Fixed minor bug where CFFI _get_cursor() did not note its idea of
  the current key and value were up to date.

* Cursor.replace() and Cursor.pop() updated for MDB_DUPSORT databases. For
  pop(), the first data item is popped and returned. For replace(), the first
  data item is returned, and all duplicates for the key are replaced.

* Implement remaining Cursor methods necessary for working with MDB_DUPSORT
  databases: next_dup(), next_nodup(), prev_dup(), prev_nodup(), first_dup(),
  last_dup(), set_key_dup(), set_range_dup(), iternext_dup(),
  iternext_nodup(), iterprev_dup(), iterprev_nodup().

* The default for Transaction.put(dupdata=...) and Cursor.put(dupdata=...) has
  changed from False to True. The previous default did not reflect LMDB's
  normal mode of operation.

* LMDB 0.9.11 is bundled along with extra fixes from upstream Git.


2014-01-18 v0.78

* Patch from bra-fsn to fix LMDB_LIBDIR.

* Various inaccurate documentation improvements.

* Initial work towards Windows/Microsoft Visual C++ 9.0 build.

* LMDB 0.9.11 is now bundled.

* To work around install failures minimum CFFI version is now >=0.8.0.

* ticket #38: remove all buffer object hacks. This results in ~50% slowdown
  for cursor enumeration, but results in far simpler object lifetimes. A
  future version may introduce a better mechanism for achieving the same
  performance without loss of sanity.


2013-11-30 v0.77

* Added Environment.max_key_size(), Environment.max_readers().

* CFFI now raises the correct Error subclass associated with an MDB_* return
  code.

* Numerous CFFI vs. CPython behavioural inconsistencies have been fixed.

* An endless variety of Unicode related 2.x/3.x/CPython/CFFI fixes were made.

* LMDB 0.9.10 is now bundled, along with some extra fixes from Git.

* Added Environment(meminit=...) option.


2013-10-28 v0.76

* Added support for Environment(..., readahead=False).

* LMDB 0.9.9 is now bundled.

* Many Python 2.5 and 3.x fixes were made. Future changes are automatically
  tested via Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/dw/py-lmdb>.

* When multiple cursors exist, and one cursor performs a mutation,
  remaining cursors may have returned corrupt results via key(), value(),
  or item(). Mutations are now explicitly tracked and cause the cursor's
  data to be refreshed in this case.

* setup.py was adjusted to ensure the distutils default of '-DNDEBUG' is never
  defined while building LMDB. This caused many important checks in the engine
  to be disabled.

* The old 'transactionless' API was removed. A future version may support the
  same API, but the implementation will be different.

* Transaction.pop() and Cursor.pop() helpers added, to complement
  Transaction.replace() and Cursor.replace().
